The flood-pedestrian simulator is an agent-based model, that is developed to be built and run within the [FLAMEGPU](http://www.flamegpu.com/) framework, that is a computational platform for the simulation of multiple agent interactions on the Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) for parallel processing.

The **FloodPedestrian_2020** folder consists of codes that is used to dynamically couple a hydrodynamic model to a pedestrian model to build and run within the [FLAMEGPU](http://www.flamegpu.com/) framework, that is a computational platform for the simulation of multiple agent interactions on CUDA Cores for parallel processing on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). More information about the development stages and evaluation of the simulator can be found in [Shirvani et al. (2020)](https://iwaponline.com/jh/article/22/5/1078/75432/Agent-based-modelling-of-pedestrian-responses) and [Shirvani et al. (2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfr3.12695). 

The flood-pedestrian simulator is an agent-based model that can be used to model evacuation of large crowds in small urban areas together with the dynamic interactions that may occure between individuals and floodwater at a microscopic level.
