One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
By clonnig/downloading this repo's content you will have access to the flood-pedestrian source code, functions.c, and descriptions of agents, XMLModelFile.xml required to build and run a model on FLAMEGPU framework.

### Prerequisites
Before clon/download, consider the following things that you need. 

#### Required software
+ **FLAMEGPU v1.5** - you can get it from [FLAMEGPU master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU) on your local machine - For more information about FLAMEGPU and download the latest Technical Report and User Guide go to http://www.flamegpu.com/.
+ **Visual Studio 2015 or earlier** - you can download the latest version of the Visual Studia from [Microsoft website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). 
+ **CUDA Toolkit 10.1** - You can download it from [Nvidia's developer download archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-base) - alternatively you may use later versions, but it needs further manual modification to the generated solution (see note 1).

#### Required hardware
+ Nvidia Graphics card with minimum 2GB GDDR memory
