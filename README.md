One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
By clonnig/downloading this repo's content you will have access to the flood-pedestrian source code, functions.c, and descriptions of agents, XMLModelFile.xml required to build and run a model on FLAMEGPU framework.

### Prerequisites
Before clonning/downdloading, consider the following things that you need. 

#### Required software
