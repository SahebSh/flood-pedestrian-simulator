	//				* Operates on two different time-steps, it can both take a user-defined dt (in 0.xml file) 
	//				  for the simulation of pedestrians (where the there is no water flow and no need for stablising 
	//				  the numerical solution by defining appropriate dt), AND it can set another time-step where 
	//				  there is a water flow and the model needs to be stabilised. The later one can alternatively be set to  
	//				  work on adaptive time stepping by taking the minimum calculated time-step of all the flood agents in the model
	//			
	//	2- Calculates the simulation time from the start of the simulation, with respect to the defined time-step (see 1)
	//			
	//	3- Sets the number of hero pedestrians based on the pre-defined percentage in 0.xml file 'hero_percentage'
	//			
	//	4- Counts the number of pedestrians based on their states with respect to the flood water (e.g. dead, alive, etc)
	//	
	//	5- Issue an emergency alarm based on maximum depth and velocity of the water, it operates based on Hazard Rate (HR) 
	//		defined by Enrironment Agency EA guidence document, it operates to define four different situations
	//		ALSO, when the evacuation time is reached, the emergency alarm is issued prior to the start of the flood, however, 
	//		if there is no degined evacuation time, once the flooding starts, the emergency alarm is issued and everyone is 
	//		supposed to evacuate the area instantly. 
	//	
	//	6- The probablity of exit points and emission rate is modified to force the pedestrians using only the 
	//		emergency exit defined by user in 0.xml file. ALSO, in the time of evacuation there is no emission of the pedestrians
	//		from the exit points
	//	
	//	7- Set the number of sandbags required to fill one single navmap/flood agent in order to increase the topography
	//		up to the height of sandbags
	//
	//	8- Calculates the extended length, and updates the number of layers which is being applied and already applied
	//		more explanation: There is a need to update the number of layers once one layer is applied, e.g. once the first layer 
	//		is completed along the length of defined dike, then the second layer is expected to be applied. Subsequently, 
	//		based on the number of layers, the topography is raised with respect to the height of a sandbag. 
	//
	//	9- Finishes sandbagging process once it reaches to the defined height of dike
	//
	// **** WHAT is missing (for MS to consider later): (MS comments)
	//		1- the model does not observe the proposed width of sandbag dike
